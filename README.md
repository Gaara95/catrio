# Catrio
A mario like game, but with cats.

We will be using Godot 2.1, we couldn't get Godot 3 to run on our hardware, since it needs openGL 3.3 and above and our hardware doesn't support it, suboptimal.

# Installing and using:

* clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sit-on-cushions-we-must/catrio.git`, 
or download all the files.
